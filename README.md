# FILE EXPLORER RIGHT CLICK MENU ADDITIONS:

These features work by making very simple entries to your registry.  
However some people that make any changes to their registry like to back it up first.  
So although all of these `.reg` files are tested and safe, it doesn't hurt to make a system restore point first. *(Optional)*

If any features somehow don't work for you there are uninstall files for each feature.

Pick & choose the ones you want they aren't bundled together

Works on Windows 10/11

**NOTE:**  
*The open PowerShell here option opens PowerShell inside of Command Prompt*

---

# HOW TO USE:

All you need to do is double click the install `.reg` files  
Select **Yes** on the make changes to your device pop up > **Yes** on the disclaimer > **Ok` on the success confirmation 

Test it with your File Explorer right click menu, on both blank space & a selected file > right click *(dependant on the feature you installed)*

If any somehow a feature didn't work for you, you can uninstall with the uninstall `.reg`'s there is one for every install

---

**If you can't see any changes after installing a feature, try restarting your File Explorer:**

Task Manager > Windows Explorer > Right Click > Restart
